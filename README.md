Scratch implementation of Linear Regression.

Linear Regression: The method of estimation or prediction of a certain unseen datapoint after a mechanism of continuous learning phase, is known as Regression.
Generally, the word 'regression' translates down to "identifying the relationship between the independent variable(X) and dependent variable(Y)" from statistics. This can be further understood by raising the dimension of the independent variable to any intergral value (n). Considering N- datapoints or simply N-such (X-Y)pairs. One set is known as a datapoint/ data-record. This implementation can be read and understood by estimating the Cost_function. This cost function is defined as the difference between the actual and the predicted output. The cost function invloves in finding out the gradient of the weights which build the relationship between dependent and independent variable.
